LESSON 6: READING THE FILE (DISPLAY CONTENT)
CAT AND VIM

cat - better to print with text files, not binary generally

file (filename) - check type of file

VIM AND VIEW (VI)

cat just prints the file

vi is a fully functional and very powerful text editor

ESC - :q - (exit VIM)
:q! - (discard changes)
:wq - (save changes, write and quit)

ESC switches between modes in VIM - Insert (edit file) mode and Command mode (interact with VIM and do actions, for ex. save and quit). Visual mode - selection of text.

When entering VIM it usually starts with COMMAND mode.

vim testfile

view testfile (view only mode)

LESS AND MORE
Downside of cat is it prints the whole file in one shot, making it inconvenient to go through large files.

more testfile - user enter and space to move up, press q to quit
less testfile - better navigation back and forth, use / to search strings
/Resolution (search string in less mode)          n    N     (search, up, down)

arrow keys, space, enter - navigate

cat testfile | more
cat testfile | less
(use cat, more, less together with pipes)


TAIL AND HEAD
head testfile (default first 10 lines printed)
head -n2 testfile (first 2 lines)
head -n22 testfile (first 22 lines)

tail testfile prints 10 last lines.
tail -n2 testfile will print 2 last lines, and
tail -n22 testfile will show 22 lines.
BOTH HEAD AND TAIL CAN BE USED WITH PIPES :

cat testfile | tail -n1          (same as : tail -n1 testfile)
cat testfile | head		   (same as : head testfile)


cat testfile | head -n4 | tail -n2
(prints 5th and 6th lines) (first 4 lines head, 2 lines after tail)
